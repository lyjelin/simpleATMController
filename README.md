Implementing a Simple ATM Controller

### Requirements

1. Insert Card 
2. Enter PIN number  
3. Select Account  
4. See Balance/Deposit/Withdraw

For simplification, there are only 1 dollar bills in this world, no cents. 

Thus account balance can be represented in integer.

### Getting Started with : 

1. Insert Card as **Enter Card Number** (6-digit i.e. 000000)
2. Enter Pin number (4-digit i.e.2017)
3. If pin number is invalid, the Authentication fails and ATM system will terminate
4. If pin number is correct Authentication will be successful and show account selection page.
